## Autogeneration of .docx Document

This repository contains a CI/CD pipeline that automatically generates a .docx document from the markdown files in the `document` folder. The generated document is stored in the `doc_pipeline` folder. The tool used is [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), which is a universal document converter. The pipeline is triggered on every push to the `main` branch and creates a new version of the document. The creation of the file is supported by a `custom-reference.docx` file that contains the styles and formatting for the document.

This autogenerated file will still need some manual adjustments, such as the table of contents and the table of figures. The autogenerated file is not intended to be used as a final document, but rather as a starting point for further editing.
