## Autogeneration of .docx Document

This repository contains a CI/CD pipeline that automatically generates a .docx document from the markdown files that are in the `document` folder. The generated document is stored in the `doc-pipeline` folder as `auto-generated-documentation.docx`. The tool used is [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), which is a universal document converter. The pipeline is triggered on every push to the `main` branch if something changed within `document` and creates a new version of the document. The creation of the file is supported by a `custom-reference.docx` file that contains the styles and formatting given by eCH for the document.

This autogenerated file will still need quite some manual adjustments, such as the table of contents and the table of figures and tables. The autogenerated file is not intended to be used as a final document, but rather as a starting point for further editing.
